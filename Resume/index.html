                I am a Web Devloper and Designer based in Denver CO.
                Begining in 2014 I studied Fine Art and Sculpture at RMCAD where I
                found inspiration in designers and artists contributing to the contemporary
                art space based around an emerging cross section between technology, design, and philosophy.
                This led me to begin working with front end languages, such as HTML and Javascript, and designing my own spaces online spaces as well as 
                showing fine art in contemporary gallery spaces. My passion lies in finding technical solutions
                to every day problems using a marriage of design and function. 
                I am proficient in Javascript, Typescript, React, React Hooks, HTML/CSS, and Next.JS. Please check my Github (link'd below)
                to review my previous art and freelance Wed Dev / Design projects.
